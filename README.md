KEGGlincs is an R package that provides a seamless interface for viewing detailed versions of KEGG pathways in Cytoscape such that the exact relationships (*edges*) that exist between pathway elements (*nodes*) are visualized in a meaningful manner.  

This package is intended to be used as a tool to accurately regenerate KEGG pathways with *expanded* edges that are marked-up (in terms of color or color+width) to portray specific *edge attributes*.  Specifically, 
- the edges are *expanded* to represent all relationships between genes encoded by the [KGML file] (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/xml/) but not necessarily represented in the original [KEGG] pathway.  This 'expansion' occurs either because:
  - one node may represent many [often paralogous] genes.
  - a node is of type 'group' and represents two or more genes that are part of the same functional complex.
- the *edge attributes* represented can be specified by the user as either:
  - Functional - the exact *type* and [in some cases] *subtype* of the relationship defined by the KGML file.
  - Data driven - based on quantitative experimental evidence for gene-gene relationships generated by experimental data.  As an added feature and motivating example, this package gives users an opportunity to use [LINCS L1000 knock-out data] (http://www.lincscloud.org/l1000/) in order to analyze/visualize the pathway edges as they pertain to specific [cell lines] (http://www.lincscloud.org/cell_types/). 

Aside from edge-specific annotation/mark-up, a unique feature of this package lies in the ability for users to generate graph objects in R and send them to [Cytoscape] (http://www.cytoscape.org/) for an interactive visualization experience via utilities developed by the [cyREST team] (https://github.com/idekerlab/cy-rest-R).

The following example showcases the ideas described above.

##Example: p53 pathway

###Original KEGG pathway:

###Using KEGGlincs without adding data: 
####Detailed pathway visualized in Cytoscape 
 - Explicitly shows all documented edges
 - Color-coded to easily interpret edge type (i.e. activation, inhibition, etc.)
   - Edge color key: <a><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/uc-bd2k/KEGGlincs/master/vignettes/image_files/color_1.svg"/></a>

*Note: An open Cytoscape session is required for pathway visualization; i.e. make sure that Cytoscape is open before running the following commands*
```{r}
KEGG_lincs("hsa04115")
```

###Overlay pathway edges with LINCS data: 
####Pathway with edge attributes generated from LINCS L1000 knock-out data, *refined* by cell-line specific expression (default option, see below), and visualized in Cytoscape 
 - Explicitly shows all documented edges; edges that do not exist in the data appear but are not marked-up for interpretation [of significance].
   - If baseline expression data is available for the selected cell-line, the pathway will be *refined* to only include edges between genes that are expressed in a given cell line.  The nodes for unexpressed genes are colored gray.  
 - Widths: Magnitude of concordance for the edge in the selected cell-type
 - Colors: Direction and significance for the edge in the selected cell-type (based on a modified odds-ratio score).  
   - Edge color key (+/- refers to *direction* of score; scores are considered significant if adjusted p-value is >= 0.05):
